# Data Cleaning with Python Pandas
A messy movie dataset is cleaned and transformed using the Pandas python library. The messy data is 'messy_data.csv' while the clean version is represented in two different
csv formats.
- The first is the 'clean_movie_data.csv' and...
- The second is the 'clean_one_hot_data.csv'
The major difference between the two version is the distinct way the 'genre' column has been represented. The first version represents the column as a string containing
comma separated movie genres while the second version represents unique movie genres as distinct columns and represents whether a movie categorizes the movie genres using
one-hot encoding (i.e. binary 1/0 format)
